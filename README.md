# Assignment 2

### Section 1:
-   Compute the time for sorting array and white box testing

It includes:
- Output
    - output images
- main.cpp
    - The original execution of the program starts from the main.cpp file.
        - main function will create 30 different (10 of same) sized array and calculate the sorting time of random,sorted and inverted array and print it in the console in a well formatted way.

- function.h
    - This header file includes all the function declaration.
        - calTime function will calculate the time to sort the array.
        - printResult function will print the result on the console.
        - printTestHeader function will print the header for the test cases for each column.
        - storeResult function calculate the sorting time of the array and store it in the result.

- function.cpp
    - This file includes all the function definition of all the functions declared in the function.h file.


### Section 2:
-   It will execute the white box testing.

It includes:
- Output
    - output images
- main.cpp
     - This file includes the main function and print the test cases for sin and cos function.

- sin_cos.cpp
    - This file includes all the functions for testing the program of sin and cos function.
        - checkResult function will check the expected and the actual value.
        - printTest function will print the test cases on the console.
        - printLine function will print he line between two test cases.
        - display function will print all the values to the console.
        - printSinResult function will print the calculates sin values.
        - printCosResult function will print the calculates cos values.
